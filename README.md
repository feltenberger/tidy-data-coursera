# Code
All of the code is contained in a single location: the `run_analysis.R` file. It assumes that the UCI HAR Dataset is in the current working directory to operate properly.

# Output
The output from `run_analysis.R` will be stored in the file `tidy-data.txt`. It is a 'wide' tidy file that can be loaded using read.table.
